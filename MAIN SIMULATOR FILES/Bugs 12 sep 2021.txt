LBA-RL GitHub code has bug when landmark is on all 4 sides
There are two sources for this bug both on act and reward: 1) for landmarks less than 3 angle is added by 180 2) calculated angle action can get negative sometimes which will cause the robot to stick to wall.
In getQRs, false usage of allRobotIndx=np.delete(allRobotIndx,allRobotIndx==i) causes robot to sometimes not detect QRs
